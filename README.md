# CCF Tanay Attendance

A simple program that automates the attendance tracking of CCF Tanay's members in physical gatherings by scanning their personal QR codes. It also generates an Excel file that contains information about each attendee.

This program was created with the purpose of replacing handwritten attendance tracking to further reduce physical contact amongst attendees during the pandemic and to aid in contact tracing.
