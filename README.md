# CCF Tanay Attendance Tracker

A program that automates the attendance tracking of CCF Tanay in physical gatherings by scanning attendees' personal QR codes. It also generates an Excel file that contains information about each attendee.

This program was initially created with the purpose of replacing handwritten attendance tracking to further reduce physical contact amongst attendees during the pandemic and to aid in contact tracing.
